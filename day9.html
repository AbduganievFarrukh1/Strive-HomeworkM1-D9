    <!-- Create programmatically (using JS) a bingo board with 76 cells, numbered
    from 1 to 76. Create a button to randomize a number from 1 to 76. 
    The cell with same number should be highlighted in some way on the bingo board.


             //---------Extra:--------------//


    EXTRA: - Make sure to always select a new number (eg. avoid getting the
    number 10 multiple times). - Create a user board with 24 randomized numbers
    that highlights as the main board does. - Let the user choose how many user
    boards he's willing to play with and generate them before starting to play. -->
